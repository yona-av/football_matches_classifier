    "## Abstract \n",
    "In this project I created a binary classifier (win vs lose and draw). The ability to predic if a team will win, based on match statistics, could be very usefull tool to gain insights. Such a model could be used by a coaching staff of a team, for example develope a more targeted work on attributes that are highly correlated to winning. Another market that could benefit from this kind of a model is the betting market.\n",
    "\n",
    "I gathered the data from rbref.com with a scraper I wrote using BeautifulSoup. Then I did EDA and some data-processing that mostly included dealing with nan values. The next step was feature selction using: p-value test, correlation test and omitting features tha might indicate a win (e.g scored_goals, clean_sheet). \n",
    "For the training part I tried three different classifiers : **RandomForest**, **SGD** and **logistic regression** which gave the best results : **f-score** = 0.82 and cross-validation cv=3, gave an average of **0.82**, **0.79**, **0.78** for **accuracy**, **precision** and **recall** accordingly. \n",

    "         The test calculates the P-value between the target feature and all the other features. If the value is larger then a chosen threshold (alpha) then the relationship between the target and the feature is coincidental and the feature is dropped. Otherwise it indicates that there is a statistical significance between them."
